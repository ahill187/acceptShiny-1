### Smoking Status

***

Smoking status refers to whether the patient is currently an active smoker. Being a past smoker or a second-hand smoker does not constitute as being a current smoker. 

WARNING: The effect of smoking status in the model is NOT CAUSAL. Changing the value for a single patient to estimate the effect of a change in smoking status be misleading and should be avoided.
